Description of run_analysis.R 

The script combines the feature datasets X_test and X_train into the ‘data’ dataframe
using cbind and column names of the dataframe are assigned from the features.txt file.
It then removes the columns in ‘data’ that do not have “mean” or “std” in the name.
Similarly activity and subject data is combined in the same order as features, and
merged at the beginning of the ‘data’ dataframe using cbind. Column name for subjects
is ‘subject’ and for activities is ‘activity’. The script then creates a ‘final_outcome’
variable that groups by subject and activity and summarizes the mean of each feature.
This result is printed on the screen and well as written to the file mydata.txt.

data: data frame of combined test and train features, subjects and labels
label: contain feature label names from features.txt
activity: combined list of activities associated with each feature from test and train sets
activity_label: description of activity
subject: combined list of subjects  from test and train sets
final_outcome: final tidy data summary
