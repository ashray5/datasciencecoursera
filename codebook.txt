\f0\fs24 \cf0 Description of run_analysis.R \
\
The script combines the feature datasets X_test and X_train into the \'91data\'92 dataframe using cbind and column names of the dataframe are assigned from the features.txt file. It then removes the columns in \'91data\'92 that do not have \'93mean\'94 or \'93std\'94 in the name. Similarly activity and subject data is combined in the same order as features, and merged at the beginning of the \'91data\'92 dataframe using cbind. Column name for subjects is \'91subject\'92 and for activities is \'91activity\'92. The script then creates a \'91final_outcome\'92 variable that groups by subject and activity and summarizes the mean of each feature. This result is printed on the screen and well as written to the file mydata.txt.\
